# ML types of games: train test, validation test, and "test test"
# train test: normal thing. You train your model to recognize some features on some images.
# validation test: a subset of the data set taken out to evaluate if your model is not overlearning your images, or, in
# the common term, overfitting itself. The validation test is important to know if your model has learned a generalized
# version of the images or if it has learned the images by heart pixel by pixel (which we do not want, otherwise the
# matching with new images will likely not occur)
# "test test": some images not related to the training sample used to determine if our model is good enough with
# unrelated images to recognize some features.
